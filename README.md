# kibernikto-planner

Demonstrates how easy it is to use OpenAi tools with Kibernikto as a core.  
Basic telegram AI planner. Can use voice messages.  
Can be updated to retrieve plans etc, just a demo functionality for now.
Reminds of planned messages.
Uses [Kibernikto library](https://github.com/solovieff/kibernikto) as a core and is mostly here to show it's
capabilities.

**All you need to use functions with Kibernikto is:**

- Create you functions in 'tools' package and import them as in `main.py` file. See `tools/plan_event.py` for details.
- Optionally: create Kibernikto child class to extend the functionality.  
  See `bots/tooles/_kiberplanner.py` it adds current time to default messages.
- Use your bot when running a dispatcher like `await comprehensive_dispatcher.async_start(Kiberplanner, tools_to_use)`
  in `main.py`

Mostly a set of tools and extended Kibernikto bots.
